## Requirements

### Tailwind CSS

> **note**
> All of the components in this library use tailwind to render the UI. So make sure you have it configured on you project or adapt the code accordingly.

### CSS colors

For this component to work, you are going to have to set some CSS variables in your `style.scss`, for example:

```css
/** Variables colors - replace with your own colors */
:root {
  --primary-color: aliceblue;
  --accent-color: limegreen;
  --warn-color: red;
}
```

> **success**
> This is a standalone component that need no extras dependencies. You can import the source code and make it yours right away 🎉
