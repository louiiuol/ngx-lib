## Requirements

> In order to use this component in your application, you must follow these steps:

> All of the components in this library use tailwind to render the UI. So make sure you have it configured on you project or adapt the code accordingly.


### Create assets/icons folder

In this folder, you can add all SVG required for your UI. You can also creates sub-folders but be aware, you'll need to format name as `folderName/fileName`.
